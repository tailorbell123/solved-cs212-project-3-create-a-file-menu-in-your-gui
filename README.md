Create a File Menu in your GUI

Queens College Computer Science Department

CS 212 – Spring 2019 – Project 3

Add a file menu to your CandleGUI with options to open any file for reading (and displaying the file as in Project 2), and one to Quit the program. You will need a FileMenuHandler class to handle the events from the FileMenu.
